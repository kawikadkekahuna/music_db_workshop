# Don't need to create a join table if you DONT need any other metadata

# on_delete: delete record when parent is deleted
# nillify: will update all FK columns and turn them nil
# default: raise error

# Database is priority when defining delete cascade rules

# Cast for external data
# change for internal data

# put_assoc -> internal data
  # cast_assoc -> external data

# Ecto relies on changeset on the model to turn raw maps into structs

# put_assoc / cast_assoc replaces the recorded, NOT adds
